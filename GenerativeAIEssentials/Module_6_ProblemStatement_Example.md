## Example: Customer Support Automation for an E-commerce Company

Let's imagine we're working with "TechGear Online," a mid-sized e-commerce company selling electronics and gadgets.

### **Clear Articulation of the Challenge**
*"TechGear Online's customer support team is overwhelmed with repetitive inquiries about product specifications, order status, and basic troubleshooting. Currently, 70% of support tickets are routine questions that require the same standard responses, yet each ticket takes an average of 8 minutes for agents to process manually."*

### **Identification of Key Stakeholders**
- **Primary affected**: Customer support agents (15-person team)
- **Secondary affected**: Customers waiting for responses
- **Beneficiaries**: 
  - Support agents (reduced workload, focus on complex issues)
  - Customers (faster response times)
  - Management (cost reduction, improved efficiency)
  - Sales team (better customer satisfaction leading to repeat purchases)

### **Quantification of the Impact**
- 2,400 support tickets per month
- 70% (1,680 tickets) are routine inquiries
- Average handling time: 8 minutes per ticket
- Current cost: 1,680 × 8 minutes = 224 hours/month of agent time
- At $25/hour average cost = $5,600/month in labor costs for routine tasks
- Average customer wait time: 4-6 hours during peak periods

### **Desired Outcome**
**Success Metrics:**
- Reduce routine ticket handling time by 80% (from 8 minutes to 1.5 minutes for review/approval)
- Achieve 90% accuracy in automated responses
- Decrease average customer response time from 4-6 hours to under 30 minutes for routine inquiries
- Maintain customer satisfaction score above 4.2/5.0
- Free up 180 hours/month of agent time for complex problem-solving

### **Constraints and Limitations**
- **Budget**: Maximum $50,000 for initial implementation and first-year operation
- **Timeline**: Solution must be operational within 4 months
- **Technical**: Must integrate with existing Zendesk ticketing system and Salesforce CRM
- **Compliance**: Must maintain GDPR compliance for EU customers
- **Quality**: Cannot compromise response quality or brand voice

### **Alignment with Business Objectives**
- **Cost Reduction**: Supports company goal of reducing operational costs by 15%
- **Customer Experience**: Aligns with initiative to improve customer satisfaction scores
- **Scalability**: Enables support for projected 40% business growth without proportional staff increase
- **Competitive Advantage**: Faster response times differentiate from competitors
