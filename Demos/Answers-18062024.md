# ECS vs EKS pricing

* ECS Control plane : free of charge
* EKS Control plane : 0.10 $ per hour (approx. 800 - 900 $ per year for a long running cluster)
* EKS : not a good idea to do a lot of small clusters because you will pay control plane x cluster count

## Example of big clusters

* [400,000 virtual CPUs concurrently on thousands of Amazon EC2 instances across two clusters.](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/mobileye-eks-case-study/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)
  * a lot of Spark on EKS
  * we would’ve had to double our DevOps team to do the same on premise
* [cluster with 500 EC2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/hootsuite-case-study/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)
  * less incident
  * less cost

* [1000 microservice](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/appsflyer-amazon-eks-case-study/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)
  * Daily, AppsFlyer’s ingress and internal service communication generates around eight hundred billion events. At peak hours, this traffic exceeds 12 million events per second
  * The company has reduced latency by 30–90 percent, depending on the workload
* [up to 1000 instance at peak](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/neeva-case-study/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)
  * 10–100 hours per week reduction
in time spent waiting on infrastructure management

# Windows on ECS / EKS

* EKS & ECS : AMI Windows Server 2019 / Windows Server 2022
  * csi-proxy (proxy accessible by container and that can discuss with CSI drivers to finally be able to interact with Windows host file system)
  * containerd
* Fargate supports Windows instances (2019 & 2022) since 2023 with limitations (no EFS, no FSx, no Spot for example)
