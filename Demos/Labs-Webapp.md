## Class settings

* always provide to students the link available in the class settings. Do not share the link the instructor uses to access the web application
* add students mail after class creation. Number of roster determines the number of students we can add.

## Manage Labs View

* students lab can be preloaded. 
  * If a student preload before the instructor preload finishes, it will override instructors one, and might be created in another region. 
  * Preferabbly don't activate the labs until the preload is completed for all students.
* Students must end labs when they finish because they can only have max 2 active labs at a time.
* To enter student view, preferably get console URL and open it in a private window. 
* If instructor wants to do the lab at the same time as students, he must preload the lab himself. Manage labs view works only for students, not for instructor 
* at the end of training, all the labs should remain active, if students want to do them after the training

## Bookshelf 

* Students can access without creating an account, but the licence will not be attached, and the materials won't be available anymore after the class closes.
