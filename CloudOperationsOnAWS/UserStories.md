## PLANA

[PLANA, Pioneers the Future of Advanced Aviation on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/plana-case-study/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)

* design hybrid eVTOL aircraft for urban and regional environments
* objective : production ready by 2028
* encountered inefficiencies within their traditional workstation setup, resulting in time-consuming simulations
* faced high costs because it relied on engineering software that is charged on an hourly basis
* Used AWS HPC Stack (ParallelCluster, EC2 on EFA, FSx for Lustre)

### Results

* 70 percent reduction in HPC simulation costs by using
  * combination of On-Demand and Spot-Instance
  * C5n HPC instances
  * Amazon FSx for Lustre 
  * AWS ParallelCluster for configuring HPC resources for each simulation quickly and flexibly.
* The airflow simulations can now be completed in 5âˆ’8 hours instead of 10 days
