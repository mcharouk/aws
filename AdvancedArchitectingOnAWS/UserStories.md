## Context
* Woowa Brothers is a South Korean company specializing in food delivery software and mobile applications.
* They aim to become a comprehensive food technology company and are expanding internationally and into new business verticals.
* They are investing in cutting-edge technologies like AI, IoT, and robotics, including their self-driving delivery robot, Dilly Drive.
## Issue
* Woowa Brothers needed to overcome the technical challenges of operating autonomous delivery robots in outdoor environments.
* Factors like weather, road conditions, and unexpected obstacles required real-time responses for safe and efficient operation.
* Existing network infrastructure, like 4G LTE, could not meet the low latency requirements for real-time robot control.

## Solution
### Solution Description
* Woowa Brothers partnered with SK Telecom and AWS to implement a remote management system for Dilly Drive using 5G mobile edge computing.
* This system allows for real-time monitoring and control of the robots, enabling them to navigate complex outdoor environments safely.
* Operators can remotely adjust robot speed, react to obstacles, and monitor surrounding conditions to ensure safe delivery.
### Technology Used
* AWS Wavelength: Enables ultra-low latency communication between the robots and the control center by integrating AWS services with SK Telecom's 5G network.
* SK Telecom's 5G Network: Provides the high bandwidth and low latency required for real-time data transmission and robot control.
* Video Surveillance System: Integrated with the robot control system to provide operators with real-time visual feedback of the robot's surroundings.
### Key Performance Indicators
* Reduced Latency: AWS Wavelength and 5G enabled near real-time robot control, significantly reducing latency compared to 4G LTE.
* Improved Safety: Real-time monitoring and control allowed operators to react to obstacles and adjust robot behavior for increased safety.
* Increased Operational Efficiency: Remote management capabilities enabled efficient monitoring and control of multiple robots simultaneously.
* Successful Pilot Programs: Dilly Drive completed over 3,000 orders and logged 1,250 kilometers during pilot testing, demonstrating the solution's effectiveness.
* Expansion to Public Trials: The solution's success in pilot programs led to public trials in residential areas, showcasing its real-world applicability.
