[Use case](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/sbi-life-case-study/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)

* Used RAG

## Context

* SBI Life Insurance, a company of SBI Insurance Group, provides various life insurance products and policies.
The Information Systems Department of SBI Life Insurance is responsible for development, maintenance, operation, and security response.

* Operators faced difficulties in quickly answering inquiries about discontinued life insurance products due to the enormous variety and volume of related documents.


## Solution Description

* SBI Life Insurance built a document search solution using Amazon Kendra, an intelligent enterprise search service, to let call center workers easily search for documentation on insurance products and policies.
* The solution includes a selfbot function that summarizes and displays Amazon Kendra search results using generative AI.

## Technology Used

* Amazon Kendra
* Amazon Bedrock

## Key Performance Indicators:

* Shortened development period: Released to a production environment in July 2023, **three months** after development started in April 2023.
* Improved call center operations: Significantly improved call center operations and reduced stress on operators.
* Shorter training periods: Reduced training periods by about **30 %**
* Increased applicant interest: Attracted applicants who want to be involved in the intelligent operations projects.

* The development of one drug can result in approximately **20,000 documents**, and scientists often must look for data **manually** using a variety of tools to find historical data
* Pfizer uses Amazon Kendra to index documents
* PACT teams now use generative AI, accessing Anthropicâ€™s Claude 2.1 through Amazon Bedrock, to summarize results and to provide orders in natural language
* give order by chat or by voice
* Pfizer estimates that, annually, scientists could save up to **16,000 hours** of searching and extracting data
  
# Media

* Used prompting
* [ABP News](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/abp-network/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)

## Context

* ABP Network, a media company, uses AWS and generative AI to enhance media content creation and procurement.
* The network publishes millions of stories, videos, social media posts, and multimedia content across eight languages annually on ABP LIVE.
* Traditionally, securing images was time-consuming and costly. The editorial workflow for images took **three to four hours** per day.

## Issue

* ABP Network needed to streamline image procurement and video localization workflows, reducing associated time and costs without compromising quality and relevance.

## Solution

* ABP Network deployed Amazon Bedrock and generative AI on AWS for greater efficiency, innovation, and cost savings.
* The solution included an image-generating application, which empowers the editorial team to generate multiple image variations quickly, and a video production application for transcribing, translating, and dubbing videos into multiple languages.
* The image-generating application creates up to 170 image variations in under 10 seconds using simple text prompts, streamlining the image procurement process.
* The video production application transcribes, translates, and dubs a single 300 to 600-second video into four languages within four to six minutes, reducing video localization time by 88%.

## Technology Used

Amazon Bedrock

## Key Performance Indicators:

* 170 image variations generated in under 10 seconds
* 5-fold faster image turnaround time
* 88% reduction in time taken for video localization.
* 50% reduction in image acquisition cost (eliminating the need to purchase costly stock images)
* 10% boost in audience engagement and click-through rates
